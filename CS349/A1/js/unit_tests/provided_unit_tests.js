         We're using Mocha and Chai to do unit testing.

         Mocha is what sets up the tests (the "describe" and "it" portions), while
         Chai does the assertion/expectation checking.

         Note: This is a bunch of tests in one it; you'll probably want to separate them
         out into separate groups to make debugging easier. It's also more satisfying
         to see a bunch of unit tests pass on the results page :)
